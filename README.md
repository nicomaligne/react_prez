- react Component -> render every children
- react PureComponent -> impl shallow shouldComponent Update -> show example with double rendering

### React Pattern

- HOC -> What's a HOC ? When to use it ? Connect example
- renderProps	-> What's renderProps ? When to use it ? Example ?
- function as children	-> What's functions as children ? Difference with renderProps ? When to use it ?
- Dodds pattern ?
