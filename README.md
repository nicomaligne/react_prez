# React presentation

## React stuff

### Back to Basic

-   whats JSX ?
    -   https://blog.kentcdodds.com/what-is-jsx-310ab98c463e
-   Component -> render every children
-   PureComponent -> impl shallow shouldComponent Update -> show example with double rendering
-   Stateless / functionnal components ( pretty much the same )

### React Pattern

-   Single Element Pattern ?
    -   https://medium.freecodecamp.org/introducing-the-single-element-pattern-dfbd2c295c5d
-   HOC -> What's a HOC ? When to use it ? Connect example
-   renderProps -> What's renderProps ? When to use it ? Example ?
-   function as children -> What's functions as children ? Difference with renderProps ? When to use it ?
-   Dodds pattern :
    -   How to enforce a component API
    -   Compound
    -   Context API
    -   Props getter
    -   State reducer
    -   controlled props

### React improvement

-   recompose

## kind of redux stuff

-   reselect for the selectors ( to avoid rerenders )
